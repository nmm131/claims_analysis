# Claims Analysis

This is a Python script that reads a JSON file containing insurance claims and prints out some useful summaries:

- How many claims there are by status (e.g., open, closed)
- A mapping of each user to the claim IDs they're associated with
- A sorted list of all actions taken on claims (by timestamp)
